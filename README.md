#### Project Description ####

Most companies complete research to determine their ideal production environments, such as shift patterns and working hours, and then adjust their environment accordingly. This project will aim to develop a system that generates ideal environments from datasets generated from past production within the company. 

This project will be a collaboration with Viridor, a global industrial recycling company.  Viridor will provide the dataset for analysis and will outline their requirements and deliverables.  The system will detail production environments that maximise production and minimise reject, highlighting the best shift patterns and seasons for production.

The system  will enable Viridor to adjust their working environments to improve their efficiency and their rate and quality of production.

The project will explore and evaluate different data mining methods. Different methods will be used to develop environments which will be compared and contrasted as part of the method evaluations. The final system will use the 'most appropriate' data mining methods and display the generated information in charts and graphs within a web application.
